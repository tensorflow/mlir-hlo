### `-interpreter-instrument-with-probe`

_Inserts interpreter.probe ops in a StableHLO program._

Walks through a StableHLO program and inserts a probe instrumentation
operation after each suitable operation (see below for how a suitable
operation is defined). Instrumentation is used to extract intermediate
tensor values from the StableHLO reference interpreter for later comparison
with other runtimes.

All operations are considered suitable for instrumentation, except constant
ops, ops which do not have any tensor return values (i.e. an op that
produces a tuple or a token or no return values will not be instrumented).
Suitable operations will be instrumented regardless of their level of
nesting. That is, operations inside loop/branch regions will also be
instrumented.

Instrumented operations will have their return values written to disk using
the NumPy data format as they are executed. If the `useDebugInfo` pass
option is enabled, location debug information will be used when available to
uniquely identify instrumented tensor values (i.e. the pass will extract
`probe_id` from `NamedLoc(probe_id@<...>)` and use the format `probe_id`.#).
Otherwise, instrumented values will be referred to in the increasing
sequence: `probe1`, `probe2`, ... See `interpreter.probe` for additional
information on how data is serialized.

#### Options
```
-useDebugInfo : Whether or not to use location debug data as `probe_id` values.
```
